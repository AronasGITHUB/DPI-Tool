# DPI-Tool
DPI stands for Debian Package Installer; it installs applications from Debian packages for you.

A debian package installer tool. 
This tool is not a debian package searcher and installer, this tool installs the app you are trying to install, but you get a debian package only.

Have you ever tried to install an application for linux, but get a debian package you dont know what to do with? DPI can help.

A: If you love GUI, you might want to install dpi-tool-gui.sh. If you love the terminal, you might want to install dpi-tool.sh. If you dont care, you can install whatever you want. My recommendation if you dont care is dpi-tool.sh.
